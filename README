   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Perl-style options may be passed as a hash reference.  Thanks to Greg Ward
for the suggestion.  There is a limited test suite as well.

I've been using version 0.01 in a production environment for 10 months now.

However, I'm the only one who has written code to use it.  The author often
does not exercise his code the way others would, having intimate knowledge of
not only the code, but the intent behind the code can limit how much the error
checking is exercised.

It is to that end (feedback), and the hope that it will be useful to others
that I make this release.  Please direct any feedback to leakin@dfw.nostrum.com.

I have dropped the rsync command-line style options in favor of the perl-style
hash.  No one expressed interest in them.  Since anyone using this module is
probably familiar with perl, and the hash-style provides more flexibility, I
feel this makes the most sense.  It also allows me to simplify my code, and
that means (theoretically at least) less chance for bugs.

QUICK START GUIDE:

   Install rsync if you haven't already.

   Build/test/install File::Rsync

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   Once installed you can use 'perldoc File::Rsync' to get the rest of the
   documentation.  Or if you'd prefer to examine the docs before installation
   try 'perldoc -F Rsync.pm'.

This module is an attempt to efficiently handle the possibly numerous arguments
to the rsync command, and it's error conditions and messages.
