Updated to support new options of rsync 2.6.7

This is a long overdue update that has been sitting in my queue.

Another update is due as well that would change to orderd args based on
discussions with Gavin Carr.  I hope to have it ready soon along with
any new option support since 2.6.7.

Although I am the original author and maintainer, many of the bug fixes and
improvements have come as either suggestions or patches from the perl
community.  The contributors names can be found near the end of the POD doc,
and full credits can be found in the Changelog file.
There have been many helpful people making this a much better module than
I could ever write on my own.

QUICK START GUIDE:

   Install rsync if you haven't already.

   Build/test/install File::Rsync

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   Once installed you can use 'perldoc File::Rsync' to get the rest of the
   documentation.  Or if you'd prefer to examine the docs before installation
   try 'perldoc -F Rsync.pm'.

This module is an attempt to efficiently handle the possibly numerous arguments
to the rsync command, and it's error conditions and messages.
