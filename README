Perl-style options may be passed as a hash reference.  Thanks to Greg Ward
for the suggestion.  There a limited test suite as well.

I've been using version 0.01 in a production environment for 6 months now.

However, I'm the only one who has written code to use it.  The author often
does not exercise his code the way others would, having intimate knowledge of
not only the code, but the intent behind the code can limit how much the error
checking is exercised.

It is to that end (feedback), and the hope that it will be useful to others
that I make this release.  Please direct any feedback to leakin@dfw.nostrum.com.

I'm considering dropping the rsync command-line style options in favor of the
perl-style hash.  If that happens, the module will still accept a hash reference
of options, and will also allow the hash key/value pairs as a list.  If you
develop code using this module I recommend using the perl-style hash reference
over the command-line style in order to avoid problems with later versions.

Let me know if you really want/need the command-line style options.

QUICK START GUIDE:

   Install rsync if you haven't already.

   Build/test/install File::Rsync

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   Once installed you can use 'perldoc File::Rsync' to get the rest of the
   documentation.  Or if you'd prefer to examine the docs before installation
   try 'perldoc -F Rsync.pm'.

This module is an attempt to efficiently handle the possibly numerous arguments
to the rsync command, and it's error conditions and messages.
