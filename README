Updated to support new options of rsync 2.6.5-pre1

If you are using an older version than rsync 2.6.2, please check out the
latest version.  There have been several fixes and significant speed
improvements.

Although I am the original author and maintainer, many of the bug fixes and
improvements have come as either suggestions or patches from the perl
community.  The contributors names can be found near the end of the POD doc,
and full credits can be found in the Changelog file.
There have been many helpful people making this a much better module than
I could ever write on my own.

QUICK START GUIDE:

   Install rsync if you haven't already.

   Build/test/install File::Rsync

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   Once installed you can use 'perldoc File::Rsync' to get the rest of the
   documentation.  Or if you'd prefer to examine the docs before installation
   try 'perldoc -F Rsync.pm'.

This module is an attempt to efficiently handle the possibly numerous arguments
to the rsync command, and it's error conditions and messages.
