      * removed global $pkgname, now uses 'my $pkgname=ref $self' instead.
      I also had to bless $self earlier in 'new' so defopts, and parseopts can
      use 'ref $self' to determine the package name.  It was not too bright
      to hardcode the package name (vacations can have odd effects on the brain)

      * changed saveopts and parseopts to begin with underscore since they
      are for internal use only.

      * added $pkgname for 'carp' messages to make it clearer where they came
      from.

      * added missing check for 'include' in exec method

      * other misc cleanup and clarification of code and documentation

      * version 0.05: major re-organization and re-writing of internal
      functions to add the ability to pass a hash reference for perl-style
      options handling.  (Thanks to Greg Ward for the suggestion)  This gives
      increased flexibility including the ability to turn off boolean flags,
      and to build your own include or exclude list as an array and pass a
      reference to the array to the module.  The same can be done for source
      paths.  

      * removed leading double-dashes from the option keys.  It is easier to
      add them in the parser for command-line style than to remove them for
      perl-style hashes.

      * changed 'err' and 'out' methods to return an empty string or an empty
      list if no output was generated.  If there was output they return it as
      an array or a reference to an array as before.  This should make testing
      for the existance of output more efficient.  Before you had to call them
      in a scalar context and dereference the return in order to check.  Now
      you can use a simple truth test.  Also added a note about conditions
      where rsync itself can return a true (0) exit but the programmer may
      consider it an error.  In these situations you need to check stderr for
      error messages (such as 'no such file or directory').  See 'exec' method
      in the manpage.

      * removed newlines from carp messages so the 'at <prog> line ##' is on
      the same line as the rest of the error message (bad habit from die).

      * changed all return values except 'new' to zero instead of undef so
      -w won't complain about use of un-initialized values.  If anyone has
      a good reason to put this back (like good/standard coding practices) let
      me know.

      * added test.pl script for 'make test'.

      * version 0.04: added missing 'next' that would cause a parsing
      error if -P was used.

      * Renamed module to File::Rsync (Thanks to Tim Bunce for the suggestion)
      It really fits better here than in Net::, but once I thought of it
      as a network-based program I had a mental block when considering other
      groups.

      * version 0.03: --address should be a scalar, not a flag (the
      rsync man page is unclear on this).

Wed Nov 17 21:20:16 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.02:

      * wrote first draft of Makefile.PL and makepm.PL to wrap it all up
      as a real perl module.

      * added new options for rsync 2.3.2 (-P, --delete-after, and
      --address)
      -P is short for --partial and --progress. --address is only
      used in server mode.  I don't know what good these are inside
      this module, but you should still be able to pass them if you
      want.
      --delete-after allows the user to delay any --delete actions
      until after all other files are synced.  The default is to
      perform any deletes before in order help insure sufficient disk
      space is available.  See the rsync (1) man page for more
      details.

      * remove any chance of clobbering $_ (mostly paranoia I hope)

Tue Jun 15 15:27:20 CDT 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.01: (initial) based on rsync 2.3.1
