Add example code to manpage

Figure out a scheme for including extended docs.  The new perl-style options
      add a great deal of flexibility.  The ability to pass an array reference
      to the 'source' option, and the include/exclude options means you can
      build your own lists and pass them to the object when you are ready.  I
      need to figure out a good (standard) way to include docs on this so
      people don't have to figure this out the hard way.  Extended examples
      should also be included (like one using Find.pm to build a complex
      include/exclude list).

Consider dropping rsync command-line style options, and make perl-style hash
      the only way to specify options.  If perl-style becomes the only way to
      pass options, then requiring the hash reference could be dropped.  In
      that case it could accept the hash style options as a list or as a hash
      reference (I'm hoping for feedback on this).  I kept the command-line
      style from the earlier version for myself since I have production code
      that uses it, but I could easily update that code to use the hash (and
      probably will very soon).
